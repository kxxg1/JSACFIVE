### randomForecast Function

The `randomForecast` function is a simulation of an asynchronous API call that forecasts the weather. It returns a Promise that resolves after a delay of 1 second, simulating the time it might take for a real API call to complete.

The function uses `Math.random()` to generate a random number between 0 and 1. If the generated number is less than 0.5, the function resolves the Promise with the string 'forecast is sunny'. Otherwise, it resolves the Promise with the string 'forecast is rainy'.

This function is used to randomly determine the weather forecast for the purpose of this application.

Here's the function's code:

```javascript
function randomForecast() {
  return new Promise((resolve) => {
      setTimeout(() => {
          const isSunny = Math.random() < 0.5;
          resolve(isSunny ? 'forecast is sunny' : 'forecast is rainy');
      }, 1000); // 1 second delay to simulate an API call
  });
}
```
